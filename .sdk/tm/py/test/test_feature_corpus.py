# Postmark SDK feature corpus test
#
# Feature behaviour, driven by the SHARED corpus.
#
# The same route test_primary_utility.py takes for the utilities:
# language-neutral cases in .sdk/test/test.json, executed against THIS
# generated SDK. The feature is the ordinary class, built by the generated
# config, installed by the generated constructor, and driven by a real entity
# operation. Not a miniature of the pipeline - that is what feature_harness.py
# does, and a miniature can only be as right as the miniature.
#
# Everything in a case is data. The one piece python writes for itself is
# turning scripted responses into a fetcher, through the documented
# `utility.fetcher` override.
