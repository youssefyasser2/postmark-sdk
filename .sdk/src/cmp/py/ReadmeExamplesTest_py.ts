    Content(`# ${Name} SDK — documentation python-examples COMPLETENESS gate.
#
# GUARANTEE: every python example in the docs is unit-tested. This module is a
# completeness gate over every python fenced code block in three documents:
#   - the repository ROOT README.md (one directory above the py/ package),
#   - the per-language py/README.md (tutorial, how-to, error-handling,
#     testing and entity-op examples — in the package root),
#   - the per-language py/REFERENCE.md (in the package root).
# It exists to keep the documented examples honest as the generator evolves:
# no runnable example may be silently skipped, and no block may be dropped.
#
# Checks, in order, PER DOCUMENT:
#
#   1. COMPILE: every python block is parsed with ast.parse + compile(). This
#      catches syntax errors in the docs (e.g. a dict key with no value, or a
#      hyphenated import module name that is not valid Python).
#
#   2. EXECUTE (the primary safety net): every RUNNABLE block is run offline in
#      a seeded TEST-mode subprocess. A block is RUNNABLE when it constructs the
#      SDK (mentions ${sdkClass}) OR drives a client/sdk variable the narrative
#      built earlier ("client." / "sdk."). A constructing block is rewritten so
#      both ${sdkClass}(...) and ${sdkClass}.test(...) become
#      ${sdkClass}.test({"entity": {...}}) seeding one mock record (id "test01")
#      per referenced entity; a client-driving block gets that seeded test
#      client injected first, then runs verbatim. Any PROGRAMMING error
#      (NameError / AttributeError / TypeError / KeyError / IndexError /
#      ImportError / SyntaxError / IndentationError) FAILS the test. ONLY a
#      not-found / 404 domain error is tolerated (it proves the snippet is
#      structurally valid Python that drives the SDK against an unseeded id).
#      Any other runtime error also FAILS. This surfaces real bugs — a snippet
#      calling a method that does not exist raises AttributeError; indexing
#      result["err"] on a direct() envelope with no err key raises KeyError.
#
#   3. COMPLETENESS: every block is partitioned into exactly one of
#      {executed, compiled-nonrunnable, illustration} and the test asserts
#      total == executed + compiled + illustration. "illustration" is a NARROW
#      explicit class — a non-runnable block whose every top-level statement is
#      an import, a signature stub, a bare reference, or a literal assignment (a
#      pure signature/table snippet). It can never absorb a runnable example: a
#      block that references the SDK/client is classified RUNNABLE first and
#      MUST execute. If a runnable block is not executed, the test FAILS. A
#      per-doc summary line (total/executed/compiled/illustration) is printed.
#
#   4. TYPECHECK (only if mypy is importable): the ROOT README blocks are
#      concatenated and type-checked with mypy as a bonus gate over the primary
#      EXECUTE gate. Only errors mypy attributes to the snippet file fail;
#      import-resolution noise is inconclusive.
