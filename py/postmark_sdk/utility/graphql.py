# Postmark SDK utility: graphql

# GraphQL transport. API-INDEPENDENT: every GraphQL SDK this generator
# produces uses this file unchanged. The API-specific part — which
# operations exist and what each one's document is — is model data,
# computed once by apidef and emitted into Config.
#
# Two jobs:
#
#   graphql_body   — build { query, variables } for a point, binding the
#                    op's arguments to the document's declared variables.
#
#   graphql_errors — lift a GraphQL failure into an SDK error. GraphQL
#                    reports failures as a top-level `errors` array under
#                    HTTP 200, so the status-driven path in result_basic
#                    never sees them.
