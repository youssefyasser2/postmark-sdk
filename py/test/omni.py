# The corpus test runner: vendored voxgig_omni driven through its NATIVE
# API (`makeRunner(specref, provider)`), presented to the corpus tests in
# the struct-runner shape they already use (`R["spec"]`, `R["runset"]`,
# `R["runsetflags"]`, `R["client"]`). No compat shim is vendored: the
# adapter below IS the whole bridge, per language, per the vendor-tag
# rollout (docs/design/vendor-tag-rollout.md, Decision 4). It is the
# python peer of tm/ts/test/omni.ts.
#
# Four local decisions, all required:
#
# 1. SPEC PATH. omni's own spec resolution expects the caller to hand it a
#    usable path. A relative path is absolutized against THIS module's
#    directory (test/), so the existing '../../.sdk/test/test.json'
#    constant keeps working verbatim wherever the suite is run from.
#
# 2. PROVIDER DELEGATION. Corpus-driven contexts get `ctx.client` set to
#    the runner's provider (omni overwrites it on any ctx/args map entry).
#    A five-hook provider object HIDES the live SDK from the generated
#    utilities that reach through it - prepare_auth via
#    client.options_map(), fetcher via client.mode, feature_add appending
#    to client.features. So the provider here is a READ-THROUGH view of
#    the live SDK instance: a dict subclass holding the omni hooks whose
#    attribute access falls through to the SDK, the python spelling of
#    ts's prototype delegation. (Upstream omni#56 tracks giving the stock
#    provider the same shape.)
#
# 3. ZERO-ARGUMENT ENTRIES. Entries with no `in`, `args` or `ctx` mean
#    "call the subject with NO argument". omni's generic rule is
#    `args = [clone(entry.in)]`, which passes one None where python must
#    pass nothing - typify() is 1073741824 where typify(None) is 4194432.
#    `zeroargs` below ports the correction from upstream omni's python
#    compat shim (voxgig/omni python compat/struct.py), rewriting those
#    entries to an explicit empty `args` in memory, for this port only.
#
# 4. MATCH-VISIBLE CONTEXTS. The SDK's context is a CLASS INSTANCE, not
#    the plain map ts contexts are, and omni's `match` walks the entry's
#    ctx with map access - against a bare instance every `match: {ctx:
#    ...}` assertion would read ABSENT. `CtxView` wraps the live context
#    as a dict subclass whose map face mirrors the instance's attributes
#    (snake_case attributes answering to the corpus's camelCase keys), so
#    omni's clone-at-match-time takes a faithful snapshot of the
#    POST-EXECUTION context while subjects keep ordinary attribute access
#    to the live object.
